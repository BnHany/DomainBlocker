IPBlocker is a Bash-based automation tool designed to enhance Linux firewall management by enabling users to block access to specific domains through iptables. This script takes a domain name as input, resolves it to its corresponding IP address, and automatically applies iptables rules to block all incoming and outgoing traffic related to that IP.
